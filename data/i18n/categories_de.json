Home fragrances are a simple and effective way to create a welcoming environment and fill your home and office with unusual aromas. Choosing the right home fragrance will help you relax after a tiring day, get rid of anxiety and insomnia, and create a harmonious space that's a pleasure to be in.\n\nBenefits of Using Interior Fragrances\n\nPerfumes are often used in homes to fill the space with pleasant aromas, creating a comfortable living and working environment. They help solve the following problems:\n• Creating a favorable environment. Fragrances help make a space more welcoming and comfortable, evoking associations with freshness, warmth, and cleanliness.\n• Improves mood. Natural essential oils can relieve stress, improve mood, and help with depression.\n• Air freshening and purification. Some home fragrances have antiseptic properties. They can be used to cleanse the air of unpleasant odors.\n• Increased concentration and performance. Aromas with citrus and menthol notes help you focus and improve brain activity, which is especially important for working in offices or commercial spaces.\n• Relaxation and improved sleep. Home fragrances such as lavender, vanilla, and sandalwood help you calm, relax, and prepare for a deep sleep.\nIf you use perfume to deodorize your home, you can not only ensure a pleasant aroma is diffused in the room but also fill yourself with positive emotions throughout the day."

This is especially true when dealing with an unfavorable microclimate inside the premises (high humidity, dust, suspended particles, etc.).\n\nThe good news is that there is an effective means to achieve a comprehensive effect on the material and eliminate the negative consequences of long-term storage: a scented fabric spray.\n\nTextile spray is a complex product made up of numerous concentrated components. The main ingredients in the composition are essential oils, which are dissolved in an aqueous medium with the help of solubilizers.\n\n*Important: When using essential oils in their pure form, there is a high probability of greasy stains appearing on the material. Solubilizers, by dissolving the oil in water, reduce its concentration and allow the solution to be used on any type of textile product without causing damage to these accessories and the skin."
